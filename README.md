# Portfolio

Simple portfolio using html and CSS 

## Description

This project consisted of me designing my portfolio that showcased different projects I completed/will complete and provided information about myself.

## Getting Started

1. Built wireframe.
     ![portfolio-wireframe](https://github.com/DiamondSClements/portfolio/assets/143464442/18640203-4165-4286-afb2-6290abd80ee1)

3. Created new folder and files for "Portfolio".
4. Linked files in VS Code and Github.
2. Since this was an assignment that didn't consist of any starter code, I started building my page with a basic html boilerplate setup.

## Executing

After building my basic starter code, I started working on other elements of the page. I divided my page into five sections.
    
    * Header/Nav Bar: The header contains my name and nav links that link to the sections of my page that share the same name. For example, if you select the nav link "About Me", it will direct you to the section "About Me". Constructed using html and css.

    *Background Picture: I didn't want my page to look plain so I added a picture. linked through html and css.

    *About Me: This section contains a picture of me and a paragrapgh introducing myself and stating facts about me as well.

    *Projects: I created a grid to display my projects. I was able to link one completed project to a grid square. The rest of the squares I linked a page displaying "work in progress" until I have more projects to add.

    *Contact Me: Includes my phone number, email address, and a link to my Github page. I made a link for LinkedIn but since I don't have a page yet, it directs you to the "work in progress" page.

    Once I constructed what I needed for my html, I started working in CSS. Assigned different elements, classes, and id's with attributes that defined sizing, color, font-style, etc. Since this is a webpage, I had to think about what it would like for various of media like cellphones vs. laptops. I performed this task by adding media queries to my css. It took a lot of back and forth to see what elements I needed to change depending on the screen size.
